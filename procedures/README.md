# Procedures

This directory hosts the procedures (UI) layer in the standard stack [citation needed]:

1) User interface
2) Applications
3) Domain
4) Integration

In this context, stuff that goes here is [the endpoints that Neo4j can call](facade/README.md), and [the mechanisms for integration with Neo4j](extension/README.md).

Code in this layer will utilize, among other thing, code in [the GDS application layer](../applications/README.md).
