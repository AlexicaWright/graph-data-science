:description: This chapter shows a complete example using one algorithm from the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
:keywords: GDS, getting started, algorithm

A common problem with graphs is the finding the shortest path between nodes.

== Example [TODO]
The example can be a variation of the one from Dijkstra Source-Target Shortest Path, potentially with:

* tracks + stations instead of roads + locations?
* added explanations
* no memory estimation (not for a quickstart)
