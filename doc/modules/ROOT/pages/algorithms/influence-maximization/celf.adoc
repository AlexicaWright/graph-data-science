[[alpha-algorithms-celf-intro]]
== Introduction
The CELF algorithm for influence maximization aims to find `k` nodes that maximize the expected spread of influence in the network.
It simulates the influence spread using the Independent Cascade model, which calculates the expected spread by taking the average spread over the `mc` Monte-Carlo simulations.
In the propagation process, a node is influenced in case that a uniform random draw is less than the probability `p`.

Leskovec et al. 2007 introduced the CELF algorithm in their study https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/detect-kdd07.pdf[Cost-effective Outbreak Detection in Networks] to deal with the NP-hard problem of influence maximization.
The CELF algorithm is based on a "lazy-forward" optimization.
Î¤he CELF algorithm dramatically improves the efficiency of the xref::algorithms/influence-maximization/greedy.adoc[Greedy] algorithm and should be preferred for large networks.

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (a:Person {name: 'Jimmy'}),
  (b:Person {name: 'Jack'}),
  (c:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (d:Person {name: 'Ceri'}),
  (e:Person {name: 'Mohammed'}),
  (f:Person {name: 'Michael'}),
  (g:Person {name: 'Ethan'}),

  (j:Person {name: 'Willie'}),

  (g)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(b),
  (g)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(h),

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=graph-project-query no-play]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'myGraph',
  'Person',
  'FRIEND_OF'
);
----

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the CELF algorithm on this graph.


[[alpha-algorithms-celf-examples-stats]]
=== Stats

:stats-syntax: alpha-algorithms-celf-syntax
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stats-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in stats mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.influenceMaximization.celf.stats('myGraph', {seedSetSize: 3, concurrency: 4})
YIELD totalSpread
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| totalSpread
| 3.76
|===
--

Using `stats` mode is useful to inspect how different configuration options affect the `totalSpread` and choose ones that produce optimal spread.

[[alpha-algorithms-celf-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

In the `stream` execution mode, the algorithm returns the {result} for nodes that are part of the seed set.
This allows us to inspect the results directly or post-process them in Cypher without any side effects.

For more details on the `stream` mode in general, see xref::common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-stream[Stream].

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm, and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.influenceMaximization.celf.stream('myGraph', {seedSetSize: 3, concurrency: 4})
YIELD nodeId, spread
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, spread
ORDER BY spread DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | spread
| "Alice"   | 1.6
| "Ceri"    | 1.08
| "Michael" | 1.08
|===
--

Note that in `stream` mode the result is only the seed set computed by the algorithm.
The other nodes are not considered influential and are not included in the result.


[[alpha-algorithms-celf-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-mutate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example, group=celfMutate]
--
.The following will run the algorithm, and updates the graph with the mutateProperty:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.influenceMaximization.celf.mutate('myGraph', {
  mutateProperty: 'celfSpread',
  seedSetSize: 3
})
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodePropertiesWritten
| 10
|===
--

[role=query-example, group=celfMutate]
--
.Stream the mutated node properties:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream('myGraph', 'celfSpread')
YIELD nodeId, propertyValue
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name as name, propertyValue AS spread
ORDER BY spread DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name        | spread
| "Alice"     | 1.6
| "Ceri"      | 1.08
| "Michael"   | 1.08
| "Amir"      | 0
| "Ethan"     | 0
| "Jack"      | 0
| "Jimmy"     | 0
| "Lara"      | 0
| "Mohammed"  | 0
| "Willie"    | 0
|===

--

Note that in `mutate` all nodes in the in-memory graph get the `spread` property.
The nodes that are not considered influential by the algorithm receive value of zero.


[[alpha-algorithms-celf-examples-write]]
=== Write

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-write-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example, group=celfWrite]
--
.The following will run the algorithm, and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.influenceMaximization.celf.write('myGraph', {
  writeProperty: 'celfSpread',
  seedSetSize: 3
})
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodePropertiesWritten
| 10
|===
--

[role=query-example, group=celfWrite]
--
.Query the written node properties:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n.name AS name, n.celfSpread AS spread
ORDER BY spread DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name        | spread
| "Alice"     | 1.6
| "Ceri"      | 1.08
| "Michael"   | 1.08
| "Amir"      | 0
| "Ethan"     | 0
| "Jack"      | 0
| "Jimmy"     | 0
| "Lara"      | 0
| "Mohammed"  | 0
| "Willie"    | 0
|===

--

Note that in `write` all nodes in Neo4j graph projected get the `spread` property.
The nodes that are not considered influential by the algorithm receive value of zero.
