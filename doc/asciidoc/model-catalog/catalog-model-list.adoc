[[catalog-model-list]]
= Listing models

Information about models in the catalog can be retrieved using the `gds.beta.model.list()` procedure.

== Syntax

[.model-list-syntax]
--
.Remove a model from the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.model.list(modelName: String)
YIELD
    modelInfo: Map,
    trainConfig: Map,
    graphSchema: Map,
    loaded: Boolean,
    stored: Boolean,
    creationTime: DateTime,
    shared: Boolean
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1m,1,4"]
|===
| Name          | Type   | Default | Optional | Description
| modelName     | String | n/a     | yes      | The name of a model. If not specified, all models in the catalog are listed.
|===

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1,4"]
|===
| Name          | Type     | Description
| modelInfo     | Map      | Detailed information about the trained model. Always includes the `modelName` and `modelType`, e.g., <<algorithms-embeddings-graph-sage, GraphSAGE>>. Dependent on the model-type, there are additional fields.
| trainConfig   | Map      | The configuration used for training the model.
| graphSchema   | Map      | The schema of the graph on which the model was trained.
| loaded        | Boolean  | True, if the model is <<catalog-model-load,loaded>> in the in-memory model catalog.
| stored        | Boolean  | True, if the model is <<catalog-model-store,stored>> on disk.
| creationTime  | Datetime | Time when the model was created.
| shared        | Boolean  | True, if the model is <<catalog-model-publish,shared>> between users.

== Examples

Once we have trained models in the catalog we can see information about either all of them or a single model using its name

=== Listing all models

[role=query-example]
--
.Listing detailed information about all models:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.model.list()
YIELD modelInfo, loaded, stored, shared
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="4m,1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| modelInfo                                       | loaded  | stored | shared
| {modelName=my-model, modelType=some-model-type} |  true   | false  | false

=== Listing a specific model

[role=query-example]
--
.Listing detailed information about specific model:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.model.list('my-model')
YIELD
  modelInfo,
  loaded,
  stored,
  shared
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="4m,1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| modelInfo                                       | loaded  | stored | shared
| {modelName=my-model, modelType=some-model-type} |  true   | false  | false
