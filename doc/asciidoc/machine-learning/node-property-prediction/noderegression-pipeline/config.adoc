This page explains how to create and configure a node regression pipeline.
It consists of the following sections:

== Creating a pipeline

The first step of building a new pipeline is to create one using `gds.alpha.pipeline.nodeRegression.create`.
This stores a trainable pipeline object in the pipeline catalog of type `Node regression training pipeline`.
This represents a configurable pipeline that can later be invoked for training, which in turn creates a regression model.
The latter is a model which is stored in the catalog with type `NodeRegression`.

This shows that the newly created pipeline does not contain any steps yet, and has defaults for the split and train parameters.

== Configuring the node splits

// TODO link to adding model candidate section
Node Regression Pipelines manage splitting the nodes into several sets for training, testing and validating the models defined in the parameter space.
Configuring the splitting is optional, and if omitted, splitting will be done using default settings.
The splitting configuration of a pipeline can be inspected by using `gds.beta.model.list` and possibly only yielding `splitConfig`.

The node splits are used in the training process as follows:

. The input graph is split into two parts: the train graph and the test graph. See the <<noderegression-pipelines-configure-splits-train-test-image,example below>>.
. The train graph is further divided into a number of validation folds, each consisting of a train part and a validation part. See the <<noderegression-pipelines-configure-splits-validation-image, animation below>>.
. Each model candidate is trained on each train part and evaluated on the respective validation part.
. The model with the highest average score according to the primary metric will win the training.
. The winning model will then be retrained on the entire train graph.
. The winning model is evaluated on the train graph as well as the test graph.
. The winning model is retrained on the entire original graph.

Below we illustrate an example for a graph with 12 nodes.
First we use a `holdoutFraction` of 0.25 to split into train and test subgraphs.

Then we carry out three validation folds, where we first split the train subgraph into 3 disjoint subsets (s1, s2 and s3), and then alternate which subset is used for validation. For each fold, all candidate models are trained in the red nodes, and validated in the green nodes.
