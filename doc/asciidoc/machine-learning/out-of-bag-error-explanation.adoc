The `OUT_OF_BAG_ERROR` is computed only for RandomForest models and is evaluated as the accuracy of majority voting, where for each example only the trees that did not use an example during training are considered.
The proportion of training set which is used by each tree is controlled by the training parameters `numberOfSamplesRatio`.
During Cross-Validation, the `OUT_OF_BAG_ERROR` is reported as a validation metric and when retraining the model on the entire train set it is reported as a test metric.
