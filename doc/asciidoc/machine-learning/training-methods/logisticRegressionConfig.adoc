| Name                | Type    | Default         | Optional | Description
| penalty             | Float  footnote:range[A numerical type can be replaced with a map of the form `{range: [minValue, maxValue]}` which is used by auto-tuning.]
                                | 0.0             | yes      | Penalty used for the logistic regression. By default, no penalty is applied.
| batchSize           | Integer footnote:range[]  | 100             | yes      | Number of nodes per batch.
| minEpochs           | Integer footnote:range[]  | 1               | yes      | Minimum number of training epochs.
| maxEpochs           | Integer footnote:range[]  | 100             | yes      | Maximum number of training epochs.
| learningRate        | Float   footnote:range[]  | 0.001           | yes      | The learning rate determines the step size at each epoch while moving in the direction dictated by the Adam optimizer for minimizing the loss.
| patience            | Integer footnote:range[]  | 1               | yes      | Maximum number of unproductive consecutive epochs.
| tolerance           | Float   footnote:range[]  | 0.001           | yes      | The minimal improvement of the loss to be considered productive.
