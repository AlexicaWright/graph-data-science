Similarity algorithms compute the similarity of pairs of nodes using different vector-based metrics.
The Neo4j GDS library includes the following similarity algorithms, grouped by quality tier:

* Production-quality
** <<algorithms-node-similarity, Node Similarity>>
** <<algorithms-knn, K-Nearest Neighbors>>
