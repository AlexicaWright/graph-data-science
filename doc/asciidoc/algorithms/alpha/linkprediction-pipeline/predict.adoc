=== Example

In this example we will show how to use a trained model to predict new relationships in your in-memory graph.
In order to do this, we must first have an already trained model registered in the Model Catalog.
We will use the model which we trained in the <<algorithms-ml-linkprediction-pipeline-examples-train-query, train example>> which we gave the name `lp-pipeline-model`.
The algorithm excludes predictions for existing relationships in the graph.


[role=query-example, group=lp]
--
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.alpha.ml.pipeline.linkPrediction.predict.mutate('myGraph', {
  modelName: 'lp-pipeline-model',
  mutateRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_PREDICTED',
  topN: 5,
  threshold: 0.45
}) YIELD relationshipsWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten
| 10
|===
--

We specified `threshold` to filter out predictions with probability less than 45%, and `topN` to further limit output to the top 5 relationships.
Because we are using the `UNDIRECTED` orientation, we will write twice as many relationships to the in-memory graph.


In the following, we will inspect the predicted relationships:

[role=query-example, group=lp]
--
.Stream the predicted relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty('myGraph', 'probability', ['KNOWS_PREDICTED'])
YIELD
  sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name as source, gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name as target, round(toFloat(propertyValue), 3) AS probability
ORDER BY source ASC, target ASC
