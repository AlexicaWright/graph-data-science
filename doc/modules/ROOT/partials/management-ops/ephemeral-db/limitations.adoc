== Limitations

Although it is possible to execute arbitrary Cypher queries on the ephemeral database, the database itself is _not_ a plain Neo4j database.
As such, not every aspect of Cypher is implemented.

The following operations are not supported:

* Creating new nodes and adding node labels
* Creating and updating relationships
