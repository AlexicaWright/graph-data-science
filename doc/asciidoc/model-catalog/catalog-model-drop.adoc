= Removing models from the catalog

If we no longer need a trained model we can remove it from the catalog.

.Remove a model from the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.model.drop('my-model')
YIELD
  modelInfo,
  loaded,
  stored,
  shared

The full set of fields returned from this procedure are:

* `modelInfo`: detailed information for the trained model
** `modelName: String`: the saved model name.
** `modelType: String`: the type of the model, i.e. `GraphSAGE`.
** can also contain algorithm specific model details.
* `trainConfig`: the configuration used for training the model.
* `graphSchema`: the schema of the graph on which the model was trained.
* `stored`: True, if the model is <<catalog-model-store,stored>> on disk.
* `loaded`: True, if the model is <<catalog-model-load,loaded>> in the in-memory model catalog.
* `creationTime`: the time at which the model was registered in the catalog.
* `shared`: a boolean flag indicating if the model is published.

NOTE: If the model name does not exist, an error will be raised.
