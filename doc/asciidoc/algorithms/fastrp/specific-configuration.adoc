| Name                                                                             | Type          | Default         | Optional  | Description
| embeddingDimension                                                               | Integer       | n/a             | no        | The dimension of the computed node embeddings. Minimum value is 1.
| iterationWeights                                                                 | List of Float   | [0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | yes       | Contains a weight for each iteration. The weight controls how much the intermediate embedding from the iteration contributes to the final embedding.
| normalizationStrength                                                            | Float         | 0               | yes       | The initial random vector for each node is scaled by its degree to the power of `normalizationStrength`.
| randomSeed                                                                       | Integer       | n/a             | yes       | A random seed which is used for all randomness in computing the embeddings.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String        | null            | yes       | Name of the relationship property to use for weighted random projection. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
5+| The number of iterations is equal to the length of `iterationWeights`, which must be at least one.
