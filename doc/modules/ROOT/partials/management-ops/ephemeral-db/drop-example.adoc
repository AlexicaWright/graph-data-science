As described above, ephemeral databases are impermanent and are removed when the DBMS is shut down.
To drop an ephemeral database immediately, you can:

* Use an administrative command against the `system` database (`DROP DATABASE <db-name>`)
* Use the <<drop-ephemeral-db-procedure-syntax, `gds.ephemeral.database.drop`>> procedure

In both cases, you need to switch to a different database before proceeding.
