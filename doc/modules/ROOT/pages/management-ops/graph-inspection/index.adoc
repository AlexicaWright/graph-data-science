= Inspecting a single graph

Inspecting a graph can be useful to validate the graph creation worked as intended but also to understand updates to the graph such as through graph algorithms.

GDS offers multiple ways to inspect the contents of a graph:

* xref:management-ops/graph-inspection/graph-stream-nodes.adoc[Streaming nodes]
* xref:management-ops/graph-inspection/graph-stream-relationships.adoc[Streaming relationships]
* xref:management-ops/graph-inspection/create-cypher-db.adoc[Running Cypher against a GDS graph]
* xref:management-ops/graph-inspection/graph-catalog-apache-arrow-ops.adoc[Streaming via Apache Arrow]

// TODO should we have the streaming arrow here? In the end its mostly interesting for export and not pure inspection.
