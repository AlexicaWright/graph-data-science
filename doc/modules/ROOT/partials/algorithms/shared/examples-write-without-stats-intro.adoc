The `write` execution mode writes the {result} for each {entity} as a property to the Neo4j database.
The name of the new property is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeProperty`.
The result is a single summary row, similar to `stats`, but with some additional metrics.
The `write` mode enables directly persisting the results to the database.

For more details on the `write` mode in general, see xref::common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-write[Write].
