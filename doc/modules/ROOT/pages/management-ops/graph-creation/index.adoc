// TODO fill me with graph data model / limits in GDS and when to choose what guidance

Named graphs can be created from a Neo4j database by using either of

- a xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc[Native projection]
- a xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-projection.adoc[Cypher projection]
- or a xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-legacy.adoc[Legacy Cypher projection]

But graphs can also be created into the graph catalog from other sources.
xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-subgraph.adoc[Subgraph] and xref:management-ops/graph-creation/sampling/rwr.adoc[Graph Sampling] projections allow projecting a new graph based off of an existing graph projection.
xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-generation.adoc[Randomised graphs can be generated], and graphs can be xref:graph-catalog-apache-arrow-ops.adoc[constructed from external data via an Apache Arrow connection].
