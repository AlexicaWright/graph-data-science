This chapter provides explanations and examples for the supervised machine learning in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

In GDS, our pipelines offer an end-to-end workflow, from feature extraction to training and applying machine learning models.
Pipelines can be inspected through the <<pipeline-catalog-ops>>.
The trained models can then be accessed via the <<model-catalog-ops, Model catalog>> and used to make predictions about your graph.

To help with building the ML models, there are additional guides for pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning available in:

* <<ml-preprocessing, Pre-processing>>
* <<ml-training-methods, Training methods>>

The Neo4j GDS library includes the following pipelines to train and apply machine learning models, grouped by quality tier:

* Beta
** <<nodeclassification-pipelines, Node Classification Pipelines>>
** <<linkprediction-pipelines, Link Prediction Pipelines>>
