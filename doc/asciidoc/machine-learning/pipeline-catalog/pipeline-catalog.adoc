In GDS, we have machine learning pipelines which offer an end-to-end workflow, from graph feature extraction to model training.
This includes the following:

* <<nodeclassification-pipelines, Node Classification pipelines>>
* <<linkprediction-pipelines, Link Prediction pipelines>>

The pipeline catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows managing multiple training pipelines by name.

This chapter explains the available pipeline catalog operations.
