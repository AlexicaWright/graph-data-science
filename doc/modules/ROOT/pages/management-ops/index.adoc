= Graph management
:description: This section details the graph catalog operations available to manage graphs within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

// TODO is it okay to leave out Neo4j here
A _graph_ in GDS can be seen as an in-memory object containing only analytically relevant, potentially aggregated, topological and property information.
Graphs are stored using compressed data structures optimized for topology and property lookup operations.

The graph catalog manages multiple graphs.
A graph can be used many times in the analytical workflow by using its name as a reference.

After usage, graphs can be removed from the catalog to free up main memory.


[NOTE]
====
The graph catalog exists as long as the Neo4j instance is running.
When Neo4j is restarted, graphs stored in the catalog are lost.
See xref:management-ops/backup-restore.adoc[] to learn how to persist your graph projections.

== Lifecycle

// TODO - reuse image from common usage but greying out the other components

// TODO what to put here now? (we have a subsection) maybe a small image which shows the life-cycle could be good enough?
To start with, you need to xref:management-ops/graph-creation/index.adoc[create a graph].

You can then xref:management-ops/inspecting-the-graph-catalog.adoc[check the content] of the graph catalog.
// TODO move to the general `inspect a graph section`
Further, you can inspect xref:management-ops/create-cypher-db.adoc[Cypher on GDS graph] a single graph in the catalog using Cypher.

=== Modifying the graph catalog

.Graph catalog update operations:
[opts=header,cols="1m,1"]
|===
| Name                                     | Description
| xref:graph-catalog-node-ops.adoc[gds.alpha.graph.nodeLabel.mutate] | Computes and adds a new node label to the graph.
| xref:graph-catalog-relationship-ops.adoc[gds.beta.graph.relationships.toUndirected] | Converts relationship of a given type in a graph from directed to undirected.
|===


=== Exporting from the graph catalog

.Graph catalog export operations:

| xref:graph-catalog-relationship-ops.adoc[gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream]        | Streams a single relationship property stored in a named graph.
| xref:graph-catalog-relationship-ops.adoc[gds.graph.relationshipProperties.stream]      | Streams relationship properties stored in a named graph.
| xref:graph-catalog-node-ops.adoc[gds.graph.nodeProperties.write]                       | Writes node properties stored in a named graph to Neo4j.
| xref:graph-catalog-relationship-ops.adoc[gds.graph.relationship.write]                 | Writes relationships stored in a named graph to Neo4j.
| xref:graph-catalog-export-ops.adoc#catalog-graph-export-database[gds.graph.export]     | Exports a named graph into a new offline Neo4j database.
| xref:graph-catalog-export-ops.adoc#catalog-graph-export-csv[gds.beta.graph.export.csv] | Exports a named graph into CSV files.

=== Removing from the graph catalog

.Graph catalog removal operations:
[opts=header,cols="1m,1"]
|===
| Name                                                                                                 | Description
| xref:graph-drop.adoc[gds.graph.drop]                                                                 | Drops a named graph from the catalog.
| xref:graph-catalog-node-ops.adoc[gds.graph.nodeProperties.drop]                                      | Removes node properties from a named graph.
| xref:graph-catalog-relationship-ops.adoc#catalog-graph-delete-rel-type[gds.graph.relationships.drop] | Deletes relationships of a given relationship type from a named graph.
|===

== Administration

Creating, using, listing, and dropping named graphs are management operations bound to a specific database user.
Graphs projected by a different database user are not accessible at any time, except for administrator users.
Read more about that in xref:management-ops/administration.adoc[].
