= Updating with Cypher
:description: This chapter explains how to execute Cypher queries on named graphs in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

NOTE: This feature requires Neo4j Enterprise Edition.

Using an ephemeral database, you can use Cypher to update your graph as well as xref:management-ops/graph-reads/create-cypher-db.adoc[reading from it].

include::partial$/management-ops/ephemeral-db/syntax.adoc[]

== Example

This example shows the creation of an ephemeral database from a simple social network graph and its usage with Cypher queries.

[[create-ephemeral-db-syntax]]
=== Setup

include::partial$/management-ops/ephemeral-db/create-example.adoc[]

=== Update query

We run an example of update query.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE n.age > 40
SET n.level = 3
RETURN n.age, n.level
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| n.age | n.level
| 42    | 3
|===

We can check the results.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE n.level = 3
RETURN n.age, n.level
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| n.age | n.level
| 42    | 3
|===

[[ephemeral-db-limitations]]
== Limitations

Although it is possible to execute arbitrary Cypher queries on the ephemeral database, the database itself is _not_ a plain Neo4j database.
As such, not every aspect of Cypher is implemented.

Some known limitations are listed below:

* Some writes will fail
** Creating new nodes and adding node labels
** Everything related to relationships
