= Updating a graph

// fIXME these parts were just copied
The graphs in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library support properties for nodes.
We provide multiple operations to work with the stored node-properties in projected graphs.
Node properties are either added during the graph projection or when using the `mutate` mode of our graph algorithms.

The Neo4j Graph Data Science Library provides multiple operations to work with relationships and their properties stored in a projected graphs.
Relationship properties are either added during the graph projection or when using the `mutate` mode of our graph algorithms.

* Nodes
** Mutate node labels
** Delete node labels
** delete property
* Relationships
** Index inverse (not documented yet)
** ToUndirected
** delete type

* also deletion of properties and so on?

* mention mutate modes in algorithms as another way
