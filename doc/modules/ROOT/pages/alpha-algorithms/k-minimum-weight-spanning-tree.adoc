== Introduction

Sometimes,  we want to limit the size of our spanning tree result, as we are only interested in finding a smaller tree within the graph, and not one that necessarily spans across all nodes.
The K-Spanning tree heuristic algorithm returns a tree with `k` nodes and `k − 1` relationships.
Our heuristic processes the result found by the Prim algorithm for the Minimum Weight Spanning Tree problem.

== Considerations
The minimum weight k-Spanning Tree is NP-Hard. The algorithm in the Neo4j GDS Library is therefore not guaranteed to find the optimal answer, but should return good approximation in practice.

== K-Spanning tree examples

In our sample graph we have 5 nodes.
When we ran MST above, we got a 5-minimum spanning tree returned, that covered all five nodes.
By setting the `k=3`, we define that we want to get returned a 3-minimum spanning tree that covers 3 nodes and has 2 relationships.

.The following will run the k-minimum spanning tree algorithm and write back results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Place{id: 'D'})
CALL gds.alpha.kSpanningTree.write('graph', {
  k: 3,
  sourceNode: id(n),
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'cost',
  writeProperty:'kminst'
})
YIELD preProcessingMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, effectiveNodeCount
RETURN preProcessingMillis,computeMillis,writeMillis, effectiveNodeCount;
----

.Find nodes that belong to our k-spanning tree result:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Place)
WITH n.id AS Place, n.kminst AS Partition, count(*) AS count
WHERE count = 3
RETURN Place, Partition
----

| Place | Partition
| A     | 1
| B     | 1
| C     | 1

Nodes A, B, and C are the result 3-minimum spanning tree of our graph.

.The following will run the k-maximum spanning tree algorithm and write back results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Place{id: 'D'})
CALL gds.alpha.kSpanningTree.write('graph', {
  k: 3,
  sourceNode: id(n),
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'cost',
  writeProperty:'kmaxst',
  objective: 'maximum',
})
YIELD preProcessingMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, effectiveNodeCount
RETURN preProcessingMillis,computeMillis,writeMillis, effectiveNodeCount;

RETURN Place, Partition
