| embeddingDimension                                                               | Integer       | 64        | yes      | The dimension of the generated node embeddings as well as their hidden layer representations.
| aggregator                                                                       | String        | "mean"    | yes      | What aggregator to be used by the layers. Supported values are "mean" and "pool".
| activationFunction                                                               | String        | "sigmoid" | yes      | The activation function to be used in the model architecture. Supported values are "sigmoid" and "relu".

| learningRate                                                                     | Float         | 0.1       | yes      | Controls the size of updates during training.
| epochs                                                                           | Integer       | 1         | yes      | Number of times to traverse the graph.

| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String        | null      | yes      | If set, the values stored at the given property are used as relationship weights during the computation. If not set, the graph is considered unweighted.
| randomSeed                                                                       | Integer       | random    | yes      | A random seed which is used to control the randomness in computing the embeddings.
