= Graph Management
:description: This section details the graph catalog operations available to manage graphs within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

// TODO rewrite this page more - such as the source is not always Neo4j anymore (f.i. Arrow)


Graph algorithms run on a graph data model which is a _projection_ of the Neo4j property graph data model.
A graph projection can be seen as a materialized view of the graph stored in a Neo4j database, containing only analytically relevant, potentially aggregated, topological and property information.
Graph projections are stored entirely in-memory using compressed data structures optimized for topology and property lookup operations.

The graph catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows managing multiple graph projections by name.
Using its name, a graph projection can be used many times in the analytical workflow.

After usage, named graphs can be removed from the catalog to free up main memory.
This chapter details all available graph catalog operations.


== Considerations


=== Lifecycle


[NOTE]
====
The graph catalog exists as long as the Neo4j instance is running.
When Neo4j is restarted, graphs stored in the catalog are lost.
See xref:management-ops/backup-restore.adoc[] to learn how to persist your graph projections.
====


=== Security

Creating, using, listing, and dropping named graphs are management operations bound to a specific database user.
Graphs projected by a different database user are not accessible at any time, except for administrator users.
Read more about that in xref:management-ops/administration.adoc[].


== Graph creation

// TODO what to put here now? (we have a subsection) maybe a small image which shows the life-cycle could be good enough?
In the beginning, you need to xref:management-ops/graph-creation/index.adoc[create a graph].


== Inspecting the graph catalog

// TODO similar to above this feels not useful to have as a section

The graphs stored in the catalog are described  xref:management-ops/inspecting-the-graph-catalog.adoc[here].


// Move this to a new section of inspecting a graph
Further, you can use xref:management-ops/create-cypher-db.adoc[Cypher on GDS graph] to inspect the graph in the catalog using Cypher.

== Modifying the graph catalog

.Graph catalog update operations:
[opts=header,cols="1m,1"]

| xref:graph-catalog-node-ops.adoc[gds.alpha.graph.nodeLabel.mutate] | Computes and adds a new node label to the graph.
| xref:graph-catalog-relationship-ops.adoc[gds.beta.graph.relationships.toUndirected] | Converts relationship of a given type in a graph from directed to undirected.

| xref:graph-catalog-node-ops.adoc[gds.graph.nodeProperties.write]                       | Writes node properties stored in a named graph to Neo4j.
| xref:graph-catalog-relationship-ops.adoc[gds.graph.relationship.write]                 | Writes relationships stored in a named graph to Neo4j.
| xref:graph-catalog-export-ops.adoc#catalog-graph-export-database[gds.graph.export]     | Exports a named graph into a new offline Neo4j database.

== Removing from the graph catalog

.Graph catalog removal operations:
[opts=header,cols="1m,1"]
|===
| Name                                                                                                 | Description
| xref:graph-drop.adoc[gds.graph.drop]                                                                 | Drops a named graph from the catalog.
| xref:graph-catalog-node-ops.adoc[gds.graph.nodeProperties.drop]                                      | Removes node properties from a named graph.
| xref:graph-catalog-relationship-ops.adoc#catalog-graph-delete-rel-type[gds.graph.relationships.drop] | Deletes relationships of a given relationship type from a named graph.
|===

== Administration

// TODO more text here?
The GDS catalog offers xref:management-ops/administration.adoc[elevated access to administrator users].
