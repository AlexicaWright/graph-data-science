= Listing graphs

Information about graphs in the catalog can be listed using the `gds.graph.list()` procedure.
The procedure takes an optional parameter `graphName`:

* If a graph name is given, only information for that graph will be listed.
* If no graph name is given, information about all graphs will be listed.
* If a graph name is given but not found in the catalog, an empty list will be returned.

|===
| Name                   | Type     | Description
| graphName              | String   | Name of the graph.
| database               | String   | Name of the database in which the graph has been created.
| nodeProjection         | Map      | Node projection used to create the graph. If a Cypher projection was used, this will be a derived node projection.
| relationshipProjection | Map      | Relationship projection used to create the graph. If a Cypher projection was used, this will be a derived relationship projection.
| nodeQuery              | String   | Node query used to create the graph. If a native projection was used, this will be `null`.
| relationshipQuery      | String   | Relationship query used to create the graph. If a native projection was used, this will be `null`.
| nodeFilter             | String   | The node filter used when creating this subgraph from another in-memory graph. If the graph has been created from Neo4j, this will be `null`.
| relationshipFilter     | String   | The relationship filter used when creating this subgraph from another in-memory graph. If the graph has been created from Neo4j, this will be `null`.
| nodeCount              | Integer  | Number of nodes in the graph.
| relationshipCount      | Integer  | Number of relationships in the graph.
| schema                 | Map      | Node labels, Relationship types and properties contained in the in-memory graph.
| degreeDistribution     | Map      | Histogram of degrees in the graph.
| density                | Float    | Density of the graph.
| creationTime           | Datetime | Time when the graph was created.
| modificationTime       | Datetime | Time when the graph was last modified.
| sizeInBytes            | Integer  | Number of bytes used in the Java heap to store the graph.
| memoryUsage            | String   | Human readable description of `sizeInBytes`.
|===

The information contains basic statistics about the graph, e.g., the node and relationship count.
The result field `creationTime` indicates when the graph was created in memory.
The result field `modificationTime` indicates when the graph was updated by an algorithm running in `mutate` mode.

The `database` column refers to the name of the database the corresponding graph has been created on.
Referring to a named graph in a procedure is only allowed on the database it has been created on.

The `schema` consists of information about the nodes and relationships stored in the graph.
For each node label, the schema maps the label to its property keys and their corresponding property types.
Similarly, the schema maps the relationship types to their property keys and property types.
The property type is either `Integer`, `Float`, `List of Integer` or `List of Float`.

The `degreeDistribution` field can be fairly time-consuming to compute for larger graphs.
Its computation is cached per graph, so subsequent listing for the same graph will be fast.
To avoid computing the degree distribution, specify a `YIELD` clause that omits it.
Note that not specifying a `YIELD` clause is the same as requesting all possible return fields to be returned.

The `density` is the result of `relationshipCount` divided by the maximal number of relationships for a simple graph with the given `nodeCount`.
