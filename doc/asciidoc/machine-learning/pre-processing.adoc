[[ml-preprocessing]]
= Pre-processing

In most machine learning scenarios, several pre-processing steps are applied to produce data that is amenable to machine learning algorithms.
This is also true for graph data.
The goal of pre-processing is to provide good features for the learning algorithm. As part of our pipelines we offer adding such pre-procesing steps as node property steps (see <<nodeclassification-pipelines-adding-node-properties, Node Classification>> or <<linkprediction-adding-node-properties, Link Prediction>>).

In GDS some options include:

* <<node-embeddings, Node embeddings>>
* <<algorithms-centrality, Centrality algorithms>>
* <<algorithms-auxiliary, Auxiliary algorithms>>
** Of special interest is <<algorithms-scale-properties, Scale Properties>>
