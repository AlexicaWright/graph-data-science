= Model catalog

[abstract]
--
This section details the model catalog operations available to manage named trained models within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--


Some graph algorithms use trained models in their computation.
A model is generally a mathematical formula representing a real-world or fictitious entities.
Each algorithm requiring a trained model provides the formulation and means to compute this model (see <<algorithms-embeddings-graph-sage-syntax, GraphSage train syntax>>).

The model catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows storing and managing multiple trained models by name.


This chapter explains the available model catalog operations.

[opts=header,cols="1m,1"]
|===
| Name                                             | Description
| <<catalog-model-exists, gds.beta.model.exists>>  | Checks if a named model is available in the catalog.
| <<catalog-model-list, gds.beta.model.list>>      | Prints information about models that are currently available in the catalog.
| <<catalog-model-drop, gds.beta.model.drop>>      | Drops a named model from the catalog.
| <<catalog-model-store, gds.alpha.model.store>>    | Stores a names model from the catalog on disk.
| <<catalog-model-load, gds.alpha.model.load>>      | Loads a named and stored model from disk.
| <<catalog-model-delete, gds.alpha.model.delete>>  | Removes a named and stored model from disk.
| <<catalog-model-publish, gds.alpha.model.publish>>  | Makes a model accessible to all users.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Training models is a responsibility of the corresponding algorithm and is provided by a procedure mode - `train`.
Training, using, listing, and dropping named models are management operations bound to a Neo4j user.
Models trained by a different Neo4j user are not accessible at any time.

[[catalog-model-exists]]
== Check if a model exists in the catalog

We can check if a model is available in the catalog by looking up its name.

[role=query-example]
--
.Check if a model exists in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.model.exists('my-model') YIELD exists;
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m"]
|===
| exists
| true
|===
--

[.beta]
[[catalog-model-list]]
== List models available in the catalog

Once we have trained models in the catalog we can see information about either all of them or a single model using its name

[role=query-example]
--
.Listing detailed information about all models:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.model.list()
YIELD
  modelInfo,
  loaded,
  stored,
  shared
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| modelInfo                                          | loaded  | stored | shared
| {modelName=my-model, modelType=example-model-type} |  true   | false  | false
|===
--

[role=query-example]
--
.Listing detailed information about specific model:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.model.list('my-model')
YIELD
  modelInfo,
  loaded,
  stored,
  shared
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| modelInfo                                          | loaded  | stored | shared
| {modelName=my-model, modelType=example-model-type} |  true   | false  | false
|===

The full set of fields returned from this procedure are:

* `modelInfo`: detailed information for the trained model
** `modelName: String`: the saved model name.
** `modelType: String`: the type of the model, i.e. `GraphSAGE`.
** can also contain algorithm specific model details.
* `trainConfig`: the configuration used for training the model.
* `graphSchema`: the schema of the graph on which the model was trained.
* `stored`: True, if the model is <<catalog-model-store,stored>> on disk.
* `loaded`: True, if the model is <<catalog-model-load,loaded>> in the in-memory model catalog.
* `creationTime`: the time at which the model was registered in the catalog.
* `shared`: a boolean flag indicating if the model is published.


[.beta]
[[catalog-model-drop]]
== Removing models from the catalog

If we no longer need a trained model we can remove it from the catalog.

[role=query-example]
--
.Remove a model from the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.model.drop('my-model')
YIELD
  modelInfo,
  loaded,
  stored,
  shared
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| modelInfo                                          | loaded  | stored | shared
| {modelName=my-model, modelType=example-model-type} |  true   | false  | false

** `modelType: String`: the type of the model, i.e. `GraphSAGE`.

* `creationTime`: the time at which the model was registered in the catalog.
* `shared`: a boolean flag indicating if the model is published.

NOTE: If the model name does not exist, an error will be raised.
