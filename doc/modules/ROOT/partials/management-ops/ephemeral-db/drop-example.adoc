As described above, ephemeral databases are impermanent and are removed when the DBMS is shut down.
There are two ways to drop an ephemeral database immediately:

* Use the <<drop-ephemeral-db-syntax, `gds.ephemeral.database.drop`>> procedure:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay query-example, no-result=true]
----
CALL gds.ephemeral.database.drop('gdsdb')
----

* Use an administrative command against the `system` database:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP DATABASE gdsdb
----


In both cases, you need to switch to a different database before proceeding.
