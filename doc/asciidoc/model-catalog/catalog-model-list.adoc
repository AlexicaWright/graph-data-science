[[catalog-model-list]]
= Listing models

Once we have trained models in the catalog we can see information about either all of them or a single model using its name

The full set of fields returned from this procedure are:

* `modelInfo`: detailed information for the trained model
** `modelName: String`: the saved model name.
** `modelType: String`: the type of the model, i.e. `GraphSAGE`.
** can also contain algorithm specific model details.
* `trainConfig`: the configuration used for training the model.
* `graphSchema`: the schema of the graph on which the model was trained.
* `stored`: True, if the model is <<catalog-model-store,stored>> on disk.
* `loaded`: True, if the model is <<catalog-model-load,loaded>> in the in-memory model catalog.
* `creationTime`: the time at which the model was registered in the catalog.
* `shared`: a boolean flag indicating if the model is published.
