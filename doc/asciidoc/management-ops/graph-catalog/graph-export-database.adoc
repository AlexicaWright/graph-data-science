= Create Neo4j databases from named graphs

We can create new Neo4j databases from named in-memory graphs stored in the graph catalog.
All nodes, relationships and properties present in an in-memory graph are written to a new Neo4j database.
This includes data that has been projected in `gds.graph.create` and data that has been added by running algorithms in `mutate` mode.
The newly created database will be stored in the Neo4j `databases` directory using a given database name.

The feature is useful in the following, exemplary scenarios:

* Avoid heavy write load on the operational system by exporting the data instead of writing back.
* Create an analytical view of the operational system that can be used as a basis for running algorithms.
* Produce snapshots of analytical results and persistent them for archiving and inspection.
* Share analytical results within the organization.

== Example

.Export the `my-graph` from GDS into a Neo4j database called `mydatabase`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.export('my-graph', { dbName: 'mydatabase' })
----

The new database can be started using link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/administration/databases/#administration-databases-start-database[databases management commands].


[NOTE]
====
The database must not exist when using the export procedure. It needs to be created manually using the following commands.
====


.After running the exporting the graph, we can start a new database and query the exported graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
:use system
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
:use mydatabase
MATCH (n) RETURN n;
----
