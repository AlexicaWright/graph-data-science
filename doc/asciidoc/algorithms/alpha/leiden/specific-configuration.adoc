| Name                                                                             | Type     | Default | Optional | Description
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String   | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| maxLevels                                                                        | Integer  | 10      | yes      | The maximum number of levels in which the graph is clustered and then condensed.
| gamma                                                                            | Float    | 1.0     | yes      | Resolution parameter used when computing the modularity. Internally the value is divided by the number of relationships in the graph.
| theta                                                                            | Float     | 0.01   | yes      | Controls the randomness of chosen community while moving nodes.

NOTE: Higher resolutions lead to more communities, while lower resolutions lead to fewer communities.
