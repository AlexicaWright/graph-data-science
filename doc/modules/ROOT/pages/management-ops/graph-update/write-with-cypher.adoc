== Limitations

Although it is possible to execute arbitrary Cypher queries on the ephemeral database, the database itself is _not_ a plain Neo4j database.
As such, not every aspect of Cypher is implemented.

Some known limitations are listed below:

* Some writes will fail
** Creating new nodes and adding node labels
** Everything related to relationships
