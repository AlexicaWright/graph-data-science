This section describes supervised machine learning methods for training pipelines in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

<<nodeclassification-pipelines, Node Classification Pipelines>> and <<linkprediction-pipelines, Link Prediction Pipelines>> are trained using supervised machine learning methods.
These methods have several hyperparameters that one can set to influence the training.
The objective of this page is to give a brief overview of the methods, as well as advice on how to tune their hyperparameters.

For instructions on how to add model candidates, see the sections <<nodeclassification-pipelines-adding-model-candidates, Adding model candidates (Node Classification)>> and <<linkprediction-adding-model-candidates, Adding model candidates (Link Prediction)>>.
During training, <<ml-auto-tuning, auto-tuning>> is carried out to select a best candidate and the best values for its hyper-parameters.

The training methods currently support in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library are:

* Beta
** <<machine-learning-training-methods-logistic-regression>>

* Alpha
** <<machine-learning-training-methods-random-forest>>
