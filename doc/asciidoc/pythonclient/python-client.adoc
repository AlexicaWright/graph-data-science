[[python-client]]
= Python client

To help users of GDS who work with Python as their primary language and environment, there is an official GDS client called `graphdatascience`.
It enables users to write pure Python code to project graphs, run algorithms, and define and use machine learning pipelines in GDS.
To avoid naming confusion with the server-side GDS library, we will here refer to the Neo4j Graph Data Science client as the _Python client_.

The Python client API is designed to mimic the GDS Cypher procedure API in Python code.
It wraps and abstracts the necessary operations of the https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/[Neo4j Python driver] to offer a simpler surface.
