| activationFunction                                                               | String        | "sigmoid" | yes      | The activation function to be used in the model architecture. Supported values are "sigmoid" and "relu".

| learningRate                                                                     | Float         | 0.1       | yes      | The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
| epochs                                                                           | Integer       | 1         | yes      | Number of times to traverse the graph.
| <<common-configuration-max-iterations,maxIterations>>                            | Integer       | 10        | yes      | Maximum number of iterations per epoch. Each iteration the weights are updated.
| batchSamplingRatio                                                                | Float       | `concurrency * batchSize / nodeCount` | yes  | Sampling ratio of batches to consider per weight updates. By default, each thread evaluates a single batch. The gradients per batch are averaged to update the weights.
| searchDepth                                                                      | Integer       | 5         | yes      | Maximum depth of the RandomWalks to sample nearby nodes for the training.

| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String        | null      | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
